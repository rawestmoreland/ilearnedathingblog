I think consumers are becoming burnt out on subscriptions. There's a subscription for *everything* these days. So I'm going to try to build my SaaS with a one-time purchase model. It's a little different though. Here's how I have [Waitlisty](https://waitlisty.io) set up today:

1. You sign up for a Waitlisty account.
    
2. You create a project. A project (at the time of writing) has 2,000 free submissions available.
    
3. At this point you can take your free project in one *or* two paid directions.
    

### Buy more submissions

We won't *stop* collecting submissions when you hit your free quota. However, you won't be able to *see* or export them until you buy more. You can buy packs of 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 submissions.

### Purchase the pro package

With the free version of Waitlisty, you have a limited number of color selections with the form customization tool. You also can't add custom code to your form (if you're into that kind of thing).

The thank-you page that is displayed after submission is also *not* customizable until you purchase the pro package. The pro package gives you access to a neat color picker for any hex color, and the ability to customize your post-submission thank-you page. This includes the ability to remove the Waitlisty branding.

Hopefully, I made the right choice. And I guess only time will tell. Currently, we're still sitting at $0 revenue but traffic seems to be picking up and we've had a few signups over the weekend.

Stay tuned for more Waitlisty fun!
