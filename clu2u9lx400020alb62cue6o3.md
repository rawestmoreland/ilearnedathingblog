## What Weâ€™ll Build

Building upon my last post, weâ€™re going to take our node application and turn it into a Docker image. Weâ€™ll ultimately be using Docker images in our kubernetes cluster later in the series.

With Docker, we can package the entire app into a portable image and then run that image on some other server. The image has its own little ecosystem so thereâ€™s no need to install all of the dependencies on the server for the app. As long as the server youâ€™re wanting to use has Docker, youâ€™re all set!

You can turn almost any application into a Docker image. You can even run an entire Postgres database in a container!

## Prerequisites

- Complete the first part of this series
- Docker installed on your machine. Check out the docs at [https://docker.com](https://docker.com) to get set up.

## Create the Dockerfile

The Docker file is the â€˜blueprintâ€™ for how an image is build. Letâ€™s create a Dockerfile in the root of our project. As well as a .dockerignore file.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
touch .dockerignore
```

The `.dockerignore` file includes files and directories that we _do not_ want included inour image. Add the following to your `.dockerignore` file:

```yaml
# .dockerignore

node_modules
```

And in your `Dockerfile`:

```yaml
FROM node:18-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ['npm', 'run', 'start']
```

## Whatâ€™s Happening Here?

```yaml
FROM node:18-alpine
```

Since this is a node application, we need node to run it. This line defines what image we will use to build our image. Alpine is a very lightweight Linux distribution - coming in at only 5MB.

```yaml
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
```

`RUN` commands allow you to run linux commands during the build of your image. This command makes our working directory.

```yaml
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```

`WORKDIR` defines the working directory of our application _inside_ the container.

```yaml
COPY . .
```

We want to copy everything from the directory where our Dockerfile is to the working directory of the container. The first period specifies the relative path locally. The second period specifies _where_ in the container we want those files copied.

```yaml
RUN npm install
```

Install the dependencies.

```yaml
EXPOSE 3000
```

The application binds to port 3000. This will let the docker daemon know where to bind the app.

```yaml
CMD ['npm', 'run', 'start']
```

`CMD` is the command that will be run when the container is â€˜brought upâ€™. There can only be _one_ `CMD` in a Dockerfile

## Build the Docker Image

We need to build the image so that we can push it to our Docker registry. In your terminal, run:

```bash
docker build -t <your-registry-name>/node-weather:latest .
```

`-t` is the image name and tag. The trailing `.` is saying that you want to build the Dockerfile in your present directory.

## Push the Docker Image

If youâ€™re logged into Docker hub, run the following:

```bash
docker push <your-registry-name>/node-weather:latest>
```

You _may_ need to create an account and then login with `docker login`

## Run the Image Locally

Now letâ€™s try it out! To run the image locally and start a container, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 <your-registry-name>/node-weather:latest
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and youâ€™ll see your express server up and running.

Thatâ€™s all ðŸ˜ƒ

## Whatâ€™s Next?

In the next tutorial, weâ€™ll jump into kubernetes. Weâ€™ll create a deployment for the image we just created in order to run a pod in a kubernetes cluster.
