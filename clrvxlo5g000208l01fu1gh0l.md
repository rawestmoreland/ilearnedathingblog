### Marketing is hard

When I started on the journey of building [Waitlisty](https://waitlisty.io), I was psyched. "I'm going to build this thing and it's going to be awesome. I love building. I'm a builder." Launch day has come and gone. After 3 weeks, Waitlisty is still sitting at 4 signups and 0 paid users. I'm learning that I need to shift my mindset from builder to marketer.

I'm *very much* an introvert. Interacting with humans for over 10 minutes exhausts me more than running a marathon. But it's something that has to be done. There's no way that your SaaS will succeed if you don't talk to people about it. I didn't *build* Waitlisty in public, but I'm improving Waitlisty in public. Twitter has been a great avenue for getting feedback from fellow entrepreneurs. [@ScottPlusPlus](https://twitter.com/scottplusplus) posted a tweet asking fellow hackers to post their landing pages for feedback and the feedback I received was awesome! It was just one human helping another human.

I'm going to *really* lean into getting my first active user between now and the end of February 2024. **One user**. *One user.* We need to start somewhere.

### The next thing on my list

I also have something on the back burner that I'd like to start building in public - an "Areas of Responsibility" tracker and dashboard for small startups. The problem I'm trying to solve here is that spreadsheets and notion databases get stale. No one *really* seems to know who owns what. People move teams, people leave companies, and projects die. We struggle with this at my current 9-5 day job. And I want to build a simple solution to help keep these things up to date and help with the transparency of who owns what. More on that later.

That's all I have today. Peace out. ✌️
