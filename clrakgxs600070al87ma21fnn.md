Two weeks ago marked the beginning of my micro-SaaS adventure with the launch of Waitlisty. Let's be real, marketing is a beast of its own. Surprisingly, people aren't instantly drawn to something, even if you've invested your everything into it. Since kicking off [Waitlisty](https://waitlisty.io), I've seen a whole two sign-ups beyond my inner circle. And guess what? Not a peep of activity from either of them.

Yet, I'm far from throwing in the towel. It's time to amp up the marketing game. I've rolled out a Google ad campaign, and sure, it's pulling some eyes to our landing page â€“ we're talking 647 ad clicks. But conversions to registered accounts? A big round zero.

Still, the journey continues. I'm brewing a fresh feature for Waitlisty. Here's the snag: Waitlisty relies on users having their own website to embed our form. But what if they don't have a site? Or if embedding sounds like rocket science to them? My solution: a feature to let users tailor a full-blown landing page for their form, accessible via a custom subdomain, like [`book-launch.waitlisty.com`](http://book-launch.waitlisty.com). I've stumbled upon a NextJS starter project that's perfect for crafting a multi-tenant setup with dynamic paths and middleware rewrites. The big question: should this be a premium feature? Still mulling over that. If it's a paid addition, a subscription model might be the way to go for these custom pages. The rest of the app runs on one-time fees, though.

Thanks for being part of this journey. There's plenty more in the pipeline, and I'm thrilled to have you on board.
